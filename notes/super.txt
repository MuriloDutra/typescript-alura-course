super() definition: 
    When you call the constructor from an extended class.
    If this isn't done, the constructor of your current class is gonna be interpreted as a
    replacement constructor to the the constructor from extended class

export class A implements B {
    constructor() {
        super()//Calling the constructor from B class
        
        //code from YOUR constructor here...
    }
}
