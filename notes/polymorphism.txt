1 - Polymorphism is the capacity of a class being referenced with another type, typically the type that class is extending.

EXAMPPLE:
    //class declaration
    export class Negociacao extends Imprimivel {
        //...lots of codes in here
    }

    //If you instantiate the Negociacao class, you can use the object as a Negociacao or as a Imprimivel
    const test01 = new Negociacao(new Date, 1, 100)
    test01.data

    const test02:Imprimivel = new Negociacao(new Date, 1, 100)
    test02.paraTexto()
